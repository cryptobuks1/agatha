# Agatha, e-governance, e-voting blockchain based system

## Roadmap
1. Write a webrtc signaling server and client for p2p messaging

3. Make the server to work as client as well.
4. Select a consensus for blockchain.

Known consensuses:

Proof-of-Work (PoW)
Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)
Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)
Proof of Burn
Proof of Brain
Direct Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) – IOTA’s Tangle is a type of DAG
Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET)
